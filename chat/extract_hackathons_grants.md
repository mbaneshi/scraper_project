**Summary**:  
The goal is to develop an app that scrapes information about hackathons and grant programs from various online sources and formats or polishes this data for easier consumption and use. Here's a high-level overview of how to approach the project using your tech stack and preferences:

1. **Web Scraping**: Use **Python** with tools like **BeautifulSoup**, **Scrapy**, or **Playwright** for scraping structured and unstructured data from websites. You may consider using **Playwright** for sites requiring interaction, such as clicking buttons or dealing with lazy-loaded content.
2. **Data Processing**: Use **Pandas** or **SQLAlchemy** in Python for data organization and cleansing. Ensure extracted data is free of duplicates and properly formatted.
3. **Database Storage**: Given your experience, using **PostgreSQL** with **SQLAlchemy** and **Alembic** for migrations is ideal for a scalable database solution. This allows efficient querying and easy future scalability.
4. **API Layer**: Build a REST API using **FastAPI** to serve this data to the frontend or other apps. FastAPI is performant and easy to use, matching your familiarity.
5. **Frontend**: Develop the user interface in **Node.js** with **React** or **Svelte**, using **pnpm** for package management. The UI could feature search, filter, and sort functionalities for easier navigation of hackathons and grant programs.
6. **Automation & Scheduling**: Utilize **Celery** (with Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker) or **cron jobs** for periodic scraping. This will keep your data up-to-date.
7. **Deployment**: For a modern deployment setup, consider using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** (if necessary for scalability) or simpler options like **Caddy** as a web server. You can use **Xray** for network security and analysis.
