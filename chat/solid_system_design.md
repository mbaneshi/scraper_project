**Summary**:  
Here’s a high-level overview of system design principles tailored for building **scalable, maintainable, and SOLID-compliant software systems** in Rust:

### **1. Core Design Principles (SOLID)**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component or module should have one well-defined responsibility.  
  *Example*: A scraper module should only handle web scraping, not data storage or API serving.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
  *Example*: Design interfaces and use traits to allow extensions without changing existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes (or implementations) should be substitutable for their base classes.  
  *Example*: Ensure that all implementations of a scraping interface work interchangeably.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Favor small, client-specific interfaces over a single, general-purpose one.  
  *Example*: Split large data processing interfaces into smaller, focused ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.  
  *Example*: Use traits for database operations to make it easy to switch from one database implementation to another.

### **2. Architecture Overview**
1. **Microservices vs. Monolith**:  
   - *Microservices*: Split components like scraping, data storage, and API into independent services for scalability.  
   - *Monolith*: Combine components in a single application if simplicity is preferred, then modularize using Rust’s crate system.

2. **Concurrency & Performance**:
   - **Rust’s Strength**: Leverage Rust’s async capabilities with `tokio` for high-performance concurrent processing.  
   - *Example*: Use async tasks to parallelize multiple scraping jobs, ensuring minimal idle time.

3. **Data Flow & Caching**:
   - **Data Ingestion**: Fetch and process data efficiently using `reqwest` and `scraper`, then transform it using `serde`.  
   - **Data Storage**: Optimize data storage and indexing with `sqlx` to handle large volumes of data.
   - **Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism to reduce repeated requests to the same site, enhancing performance.

### **3. Scalability and Maintainability**
- **Scalability**: 
  - Use **load balancing** to distribute API traffic evenly.
  - Implement **horizontal scaling** for the scraping and API services if traffic increases.
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Implement **retries** and **fallbacks** in your scraping logic.
  - Use **circuit breakers** to avoid overwhelming external resources.
- **Modular Design**:  
  - Use Rust’s crates to organize code into well-defined, reusable modules.
  - Apply SOLID principles to ensure each module is easy to extend and maintain.

### **4. Monitoring & Logging**
- **Monitoring**: Track the performance of scraping tasks and API endpoints using observability tools.
- **Logging**: Implement structured logging to debug issues easily and monitor the health of the system.

### **Example System Components**:
1. **Scraper Service**:  
   - Handles fetching and parsing web content using `reqwest` and `scraper`.
   - Uses `tokio` to parallelize scraping jobs.
2. **Data Storage Service**:  
   - Manages database interactions using `sqlx` and follows DIP for flexibility.
3. **API Gateway**:  
   - Exposes endpoints built with `axum`, allowing users to access and query the data.
4. **Scheduler**:  
   - Uses `job_scheduler` to automate and time scraping tasks.
