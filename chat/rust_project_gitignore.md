Hereâ€™s a `.gitignore` template specifically tailored for a Rust project, covering typical build artifacts, dependencies, and tooling files:

```plaintext
# Binaries for programs and tests
/target/
**/*.rs.bk

# Rust/Cargo specific files
Cargo.lock
Cargo.toml.orig

# Generated by Cargo when running tests
# If you have a custom file structure, you might need to adjust paths
**/Cargo.lock
**/target/
**/*.crate

# IntelliJ/Rust plugin specific
.idea/
*.rs.bk
*.iml

# MacOS specific files
.DS_Store

# Other backups
*.swp
*.bak
*.tmp
*.old
```

This setup should cover most cases, ensuring only essential files remain in your Git repo.

```bash
Copy code
nvim rust_project_gitignore.md
```
