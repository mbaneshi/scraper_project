**Summary**:  
With your chosen tools, you have a solid Rust stack for building the web scraping and API app. Here's how each component fits into the project:

### **Chosen Tool Roles**:
1. **`reqwest`**: HTTP client for making web requests. Use it to fetch the pages you want to scrape.
2. **`scraper`**: HTML parsing library for extracting data from the fetched pages.
3. **`tokio`**: Asynchronous runtime, enabling concurrent requests and efficient I/O operations. Essential for handling multiple web requests simultaneously.
4. **`sqlx`**: Async, flexible SQL library for database interactions. Use it for inserting and querying data efficiently.
5. **`axum`**: Web framework for building a REST API to serve your data. It works seamlessly with Tokio.
6. **`job_scheduler`**: For automating scraping tasks at regular intervals, similar to cron jobs.
7. **`serde`**: Serialize and deserialize data, especially useful for processing JSON and structuring your output.

### **Development Workflow**:
1. **Data Fetching**: Use `reqwest` with `tokio` to send asynchronous requests to target websites.
2. **Data Extraction**: Parse the HTML response using `scraper` to extract the relevant information (hackathons, grants, etc.).
3. **Data Storage**: Store extracted data using `sqlx` in a PostgreSQL database.
4. **API Creation**: Build an API with `axum` to serve the data. Implement features like filtering and searching.
5. **Automation**: Schedule your scraping tasks with `job_scheduler` to run periodically.
6. **Data Handling**: Use `serde` for structuring and handling data, ensuring efficient serialization/deserialization.
