### **Updated Toolset**:
In addition to the existing tools, we've added:

1. **`tui`**: For a terminal user interface (TUI) to manage and visualize scraping jobs and monitor data processing. This can provide real-time insights directly from the terminal.
2. **`clap`**: Command-line argument parser to allow flexible CLI options for running, testing, and managing the scraper and API, such as specifying scraping intervals, data categories, or other configurations.
3. **`yew`**: For a web-based frontend, offering a modern, interactive interface for end users to access and filter hackathon and grant information via the API. This provides a way to expand user reach with a dynamic frontend.

### **Updated Next Steps**:

1. **Set Up Project**:
   - Initialize a new Rust project and add `tui`, `clap`, and `yew` alongside previously mentioned dependencies.

2. **CLI and TUI Development**:
   - Use `clap` to create CLI commands for starting the scraper, managing schedules, and controlling API settings.
   - Implement a TUI with `tui` that visualizes ongoing scraping tasks, upcoming scheduled jobs, and data storage status, which can help with debugging and monitoring.

3. **Frontend Development with Yew**:
   - Design a frontend using `yew` to consume and display data exposed by the API.
   - Allow users to interactively browse, filter, and search for relevant hackathons and grants, providing a seamless experience across devices.

4. **Testing & Monitoring**:
   - Extend tests to cover TUI elements and CLI commands.
   - Ensure the TUI and Yew-based frontend work smoothly with real-time updates as data is fetched and stored.

5. **Scalability & Maintainability**:
   - Incorporate `clap` commands to simplify deployment and management.
   - Ensure TUI components and Yew frontend are modular and easy to extend as features are added.

**System Design Updates**:
The system now includes:
- **TUI Dashboard**: Displays the scraper's current state and upcoming tasks.
- **CLI Management**: Simplifies interactions with the scraper and API for advanced users.
- **Web Frontend**: Allows a broader audience to access and utilize the data in an interactive way.
