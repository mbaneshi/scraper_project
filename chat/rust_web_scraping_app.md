**Summary**:  
Switching to Rust for developing your app requires considering suitable Rust-based tools for each stage of the development process. Here's how you can structure your project:

1. **Web Scraping**: Use libraries like:
   - **`reqwest`**: For making HTTP requests easily.
   - **`scraper`**: A popular Rust HTML parser that functions similarly to BeautifulSoup in Python.
   - **`select`**: For CSS selectors when parsing HTML.
   - **`tokio`**: To handle asynchronous tasks, like concurrent web scraping.
  
2. **Data Processing**: 
   - **`serde`**: For efficient serialization and deserialization of structured data, such as converting JSON data from web scraping into Rust structs.
   - **`csv`**: For handling CSV data if needed.

3. **Database Storage**:
   - **`diesel`**: A powerful ORM and query builder for working with SQL databases like PostgreSQL. It has strong type-safety features, making it reliable for Rust.
   - **`sqlx`**: An alternative to Diesel, async and more flexible for raw SQL queries.

4. **API Layer**:
   - **`actix-web`** or **`axum`**: Both frameworks are highly performant and suitable for building a REST API. Actix-web is known for speed, while Axum integrates well with the Tokio ecosystem.
   - **`rocket`**: Another popular web framework with an ergonomic API, though itâ€™s more synchronous compared to Actix or Axum.

5. **Frontend Integration**: For a web interface, you can use frameworks like **Yew** (for building a WASM-based frontend using Rust). However, if sticking with JavaScript or TypeScript, use **pnpm** for package management as you mentioned.

6. **Automation & Scheduling**: 
   - **`cron`**: For scheduling tasks like periodic web scraping. Alternatively, use **`async-std`** and **`tokio`** for more advanced scheduling.
   - **`job_scheduler`**: A Rust crate designed for scheduling jobs in a cron-like way.

7. **Deployment**:
   - **Docker**: Build your Rust app using a Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
   - **Caddy**: Use Caddy as a reverse proxy for serving the web API securely.
   - **Xray**: Continue using it for monitoring and security.
