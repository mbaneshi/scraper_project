### **Updated Toolset with `ratatui`**:
Replacing `tui` with `ratatui` as the TUI framework for this project, which offers improved rendering and flexibility for building interactive terminal applications. Here’s how we’ll use it in this setup:

### **Updated Tool Overview**:
1. **`ratatui`**: For building a rich TUI that displays the status of scraping tasks, database updates, and API availability. `ratatui` provides a modern and responsive TUI experience, ideal for real-time monitoring.
2. **`clap`**: Enables CLI commands for granular control over the scraping, data management, and API components.
3. **`yew`**: Frontend library for creating a user-friendly web interface to browse hackathons and grant programs.

### **Revised Next Steps**:

1. **Set Up Project**:
   - Initialize the Rust project and replace the `tui` dependency with `ratatui` in `Cargo.toml`.
   
2. **TUI Dashboard with `ratatui`**:
   - Develop a TUI using `ratatui` to display:
     - Scraping status (current/next scheduled tasks)
     - Error logs
     - Data summary for hackathons and grants
   - Incorporate real-time updates for each scraping interval, enabling a hands-on way to monitor the project’s health.

3. **CLI and Web Frontend**:
   - CLI with `clap` for configuration, job scheduling, and database management.
   - Web frontend via `yew` for an accessible view of hackathon and grant data, supporting filtering and searching.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for `ratatui` components, ensuring the TUI layout adapts as expected across different data states.
   - Test the integration of `ratatui` and `clap` commands to validate smooth operation and error handling.

5. **Scalability and Maintainability**:
   - Structure `ratatui` components modularly, allowing future enhancements without disrupting the main interface.
   - Combine `clap` and `ratatui` functionality to streamline monitoring and control directly from the terminal.

**System Design Updates**:
- **TUI with `ratatui`**: Real-time, interactive dashboard displaying system health, scraping status, and error logs.
- **CLI Enhancements**: Streamlines management and scheduling, with options for flexible configurations.
- **Web Frontend**: Exposes data through a visually appealing Yew interface.
