**Summary**:  
We discussed building an app that scrapes data about hackathons and grant programs across the web, processes it, and presents it through an API. Here's a concise summary of what we need to do, the tools weâ€™ve chosen, and the approach for proceeding:

### **Key Goals**

1. **Extract data** from various websites (hackathons, grants) via web scraping.
2. **Clean and process** the scraped data for presentation.
3. **Store data** in a PostgreSQL database.
4. **Expose data** through a RESTful API.
5. **Automate the scraping** at regular intervals.
6. **Ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance** in the overall system.

### **Chosen Tools**

1. **`reqwest`**: HTTP client to fetch the web pages.
2. **`scraper`**: For parsing the HTML and extracting data from web pages.
3. **`tokio`**: Asynchronous runtime to handle concurrent scraping and I/O operations.
4. **`sqlx`**: Async SQL library for interacting with PostgreSQL, storing and querying the data.
5. **`axum`**: Web framework for building the RESTful API to serve the data.
6. **`job_scheduler`**: For automating the periodic scraping tasks, similar to cron jobs.
7. **`serde`**: For serialization and deserialization of data between JSON and Rust structs.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Set Up Project**:
   - Initialize a new Rust project using `cargo`.
   - Add dependencies: `reqwest`, `scraper`, `tokio`, `sqlx`, `axum`, `serde`, and `job_scheduler` to `Cargo.toml`.

2. **Scraping Implementation**:
   - Create a scraping module that uses `reqwest` to fetch pages and `scraper` to parse and extract the relevant data.
   - Implement parallel scraping using `tokio` to handle multiple requests concurrently.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Set up PostgreSQL with `sqlx` to handle data storage.
   - Define the database schema and ensure efficient querying for future scalability.
   - Implement CRUD operations for storing and retrieving scraped data.

4. **API Development**:
   - Use `axum` to build a REST API that exposes endpoints for retrieving the scraped data.
   - Implement features like filtering and searching data through the API.

5. **Automation**:
   - Set up `job_scheduler` to periodically run the scraper and keep data up-to-date.
   - Make sure the scheduling of tasks is efficient, with error handling and retries in place.

6. **Testing & Monitoring**:
   - Test the scraping logic to ensure it handles edge cases (e.g., page changes, errors).
   - Implement logging and monitoring for the scraping process and API health.

7. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - Consider horizontal scaling for the scraper and API services as traffic grows.
   - Apply modular design and SOLID principles to ensure that the system is maintainable and extendable in the long term.

### **System Design**

- **Modular**: Each component (scraper, storage, API) is a separate module, adhering to SOLID principles.
- **Concurrent**: Leverage `tokio` for async operations, ensuring that scraping and API calls are non-blocking and efficient.
- **Scalable**: The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of the scraper and API services as needed.
