**Summary**:  
Several of the listed tools have overlapping functionalities, so you’ll need to make choices based on your specific needs. Here’s how they overlap and recommendations for selection:

### **Overlapping Tools and Recommendations**

1. **Web Scraping**:
   - **Overlap**: `scraper` and `select` both handle HTML parsing and CSS selectors.
   - **Pick**: Choose **`scraper`** as it’s more widely used and integrates well with the Rust ecosystem.

2. **Asynchronous Runtime**:
   - **Overlap**: `tokio` and `async-std` are both async runtimes.
   - **Pick**: Use **`tokio`** if you’re using other libraries like `reqwest` and `axum`, as it is the more popular and well-supported choice in Rust.

3. **Database Libraries**:
   - **Overlap**: `diesel` and `sqlx` both provide ORM and SQL database support.
   - **Pick**: Choose **`sqlx`** if you want async capabilities and are comfortable writing raw SQL queries. Go with **`diesel`** if you prefer a strong, type-safe ORM approach.

4. **Web Frameworks (API Layer)**:
   - **Overlap**: `actix-web`, `axum`, and `rocket` all handle web API creation.
   - **Pick**: 
     - **`actix-web`**: Best for performance-critical applications but has a steeper learning curve.
     - **`axum`**: Easier to use with the Tokio ecosystem and good async support.
     - **`rocket`**: Use if you prefer a simpler, more ergonomic API and don’t need full async support.

5. **Job Scheduling**:
   - **Overlap**: `cron` and `job_scheduler` both handle scheduling tasks.
   - **Pick**: **`job_scheduler`** is more Rust-native and offers a cron-like interface, so choose it if you need to schedule Rust tasks.

### **Summary of Picks**:
- **Web Scraping**: `reqwest` + `scraper` + `tokio`
- **Data Processing**: `serde` + `csv`
- **Database**: `sqlx` (or `diesel` if you prefer an ORM)
- **Web Framework**: `axum` (or `actix-web` for high performance)
- **Scheduling**: `job_scheduler`
- **Deployment**: Docker + Caddy + Xray
